## Quick start

No installer needed. Grab the exe from [**Releases**](https://github.com/PookiePepelsss/MultiRoblox-RAM/releases) and run it.

Or build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PookiePepelsss/MultiRoblox-RAM.git
cd MultiRoblox-RAM/MultiRoblox
build.bat
```

> Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs). The finished exe lands in `dist\MultiRoblox.exe`.

## Features

### 👤 Accounts
- Launch as many accounts side by side as you want
- Sign in through a real Roblox login window, or paste a cookie directly
- Set a game ID, invite link, or private server link per account so it launches straight there
- Nicknames, search, and filtering across all saved accounts
- Cookies encrypted with AES-256-GCM, stored locally. Nothing leaves your device
- Auto-relaunch on unexpected disconnect, back into the same game (crash-loop protected)

### 📦 Groups
- Bundle accounts into groups (farm squad, trading alts, etc.)
- Launch or kill an entire group at once, with a shared or per-account game target

### 🎚️ Mixer
- Render quality, FPS cap (10-9999), and volume for all running instances, one panel
- Graphics quality writes to Roblox's fast flags; FPS cap writes Roblox's global client settings
- Works with vanilla Roblox and Bloxstrap / Froststrap / Voidstrap / Fishstrap
- Live, per-instance OS-level volume control
- Kill all instances with one click

### 📸 Tracking
- Automated per-account screenshots sent to a Discord webhook on a timer
- Outline one or more capture spots per account, or grab the full window

### 📊 Charts
- Browse top playing now, top rated, and top earning games
- Search and launch any game straight from the charts page

### 🎲 Generator
- Generate Roblox accounts via a [bloxgen.net](https://bloxgen.net/) API key

### ⚙️ Settings
- **General**: multi-instance status, anti-AFK, relaunch-on-disconnect
- **Performance**: RAM trim (manual or automatic on an interval), block RobloxCrashHandler.exe from starting, lower CPU priority once multiple accounts are running
- **Data & Privacy**: custom encryption key (AES-256-GCM) or OS-native DPAPI (Windows keychain), clear all accounts
- **Themes**: light/dark and several accent themes
- **Sounds**: custom UI sound profiles with volume control and upload-your-own support

### 🕹️ Anti-AFK
- Taps a benign key into every open Roblox window on a configurable interval, so the idle kick never fires

### 📜 Logs
- Real-time log viewer with in-page search (Ctrl+F)

## How it works

Roblox prevents multiple instances by holding a Windows mutex. MultiRoblox grabs that mutex first through a lightweight native helper (`RobloxNative.exe`, written in C#), so Roblox opens a fresh instance every time. Each account gets its own auth ticket before launch, so they all sign in as different accounts.

Login opens a native, chromeless window (no external browser involved) that reads the session cookie directly once you sign in.

If the native helper isn't shipped with a build, it compiles from the bundled source using the .NET Framework `csc.exe` already on every Windows machine.
